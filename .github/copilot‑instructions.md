Develop a Spring Boot backend REST API in Java. The API should support CRUD operations for a specified entity (e.g., `Product`). Implement the following:

- Entity class with appropriate fields and JPA annotations.
- Repository interface extending `JpaRepository`.
- Service class for business logic.
- REST controller exposing endpoints for create, read, update, and delete.
- Use standard HTTP status codes and JSON request/response bodies.
- Add basic validation and exception handling.

Include configuration for an in-memory H2 database for development and testing.
